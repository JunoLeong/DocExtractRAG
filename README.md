# DocExtractRAG
DocExtractRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with document retrieval to provide insightful responses based on academic or other types of documents. The system utilizes the Zephyr-7B-beta model for text generation; BAAI/bge-large-en for document embeddings.
